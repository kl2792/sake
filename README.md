# Sak√©

A simple and powerful language for building finite-state automata for execution.

# Demo!

1. In the `ocaml` folder, run `make` to compile the compiler.
2. Run `./adventure.sh` to go off on an adventure!
3. Run `./traffic.sh` to see a more realistic application of our language: modeling an FSM to deal with traffic flow.

# General Usage

1. In the `ocaml` folder, run `make` to compile our compiler.
2. Run `./sake.native input.sk output` (note that `output` has no extension)
